##  Datasets & Environments
   
### For Vision-Based RL:

- Atari Games (via Arcade Learning Environment)

- Pong, Breakout - classic starting points
- Pixel-based observations, discrete actions

### For Robotics:

- PyBullet environments - free physics simulation
- Simpler than full robotics, but more realistic than CartPole

### For Multi-Agent (since you're interested in agents):

- PettingZoo - multi-agent version of Gymnasium
- start with cooperative/competitive games
