# Reinforcement Simple Problems

## 1. Classic Control Problems

### CartPole - DQN


### MountainCar - Policy Gradient


### Lunar Lander - PPO

This problem represents an optimization problem, where the engine is either full on or turned of (Pontryagin's maximum principle). The rockets trajectory should be optimized such that the rocket lands at the landing area (0,0). Environment is either discrete or continuous. The amount of fuel is not restricted, which is beneficial for learning.
