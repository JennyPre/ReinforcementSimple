# Reinforcement Simple Problems

1. Classic Control Problems

- CartPole [x]
- MountainCar
- Lunar Lander


TODO:

Beginner Datasets & Environments
   
For Vision-Based RL:

Atari Games (via Arcade Learning Environment)

Pong, Breakout - classic starting points
Pixel-based observations, discrete actions
Well-documented, many tutorial implementations available



For Robotics:

PyBullet environments - free physics simulation

Simpler than full robotics, but more realistic than CartPole
Good middle ground



For Multi-Agent (since you're interested in agents):

PettingZoo - multi-agent version of Gymnasium

Start with simple cooperative/competitive games
